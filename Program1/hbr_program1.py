# we create an array equivalent to an ascii table

#we must first take in input from the command line

# we then split the string into 8 char arrays

# we convert the eight character array into a value using a binary conversion 

# we add the corresponded element of the ascii array to a blank string
# IF the value is equal to 8 (backspace), we subtract from the array

# we output the string using stdout

# repeat the process using 7 char arrays

# to this end, we'll build the functionality into a function that takes the amount of characters as an argument
