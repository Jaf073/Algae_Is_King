I found first found that we need to change the filetype of the download from blank to a txt. Here I found that the file was filled with 'zero' and 'one'. I also worked on building the code to decipher this and it worked for me. I also checked the head of the file to see if there was any hidden message. Finally, I used client.py and fetch.py files from class to check for any more hidden information.
