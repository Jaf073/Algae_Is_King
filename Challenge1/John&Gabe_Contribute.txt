I found first found that we need to change the filetype of the download from blank to a txt. Here I found that the file was filled with 'zero' and 'one'. I also worked on building the code to decipher this and it worked for me. I also checked the head of the file to see if there was any hidden message. Finally, I used client.py and fetch.py files from class to check for any more hidden information.
Gabe Thompson - Supplied ideas on how where we would start before, we had figured anything out.  I then bounced ideas off of my other group mates before trying to write a code that would convert the starting file into binary. Helped to write the vigenere python code that we used to find the username and password for the server. Before I had the encrypted messages we were trying to decode I was trying to help the person typing in the code when we could not figure out. Once I got the text we were trying to decrypt I then used the vigenere code to figure out the username and password and then put those in the discord for people to easily use. I then put the final message into the discord to be checked.
