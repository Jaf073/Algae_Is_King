I changed our python script that converts text to numbers to work with the beginning cypher given at the start of the challenge. I then put that binary output into a text file and ran it through our binary to ascii script. This gave me an encrypted message and a key which I plugged into our vigenere encoder/decoder script until it stopped outputting giberish. That output was an IP address and a port number which we then used to find the final covert message. Finally, I updated our vigenere script so that it will take a number as an argument in the command line and then encode or decode the given message that many times.
