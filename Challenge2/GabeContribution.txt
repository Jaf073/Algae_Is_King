This challenge I was not able to contribute as much as I would have liked because I had some problems with my VM
and with my computer deleting the 1.exe file. When I was able to get it working properly I helped look through
the 1.exe file for a password. I also helped log into the ftp server once the IP was found in the 1.exe file.
