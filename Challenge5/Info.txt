output of edited Program 5 = gives us password

Downloaded provided zip file
Cracked zip file password by passing it through a website (password = passw0rd)
Decoded the two gibberish file names using base 64 -> gave us Epoch time and IP
Used modified program 5 with epoc time and local machine time to get IP password
Logged into ftp server and grabbed the two files we needed
Used XOR program to decode the cipher file giving us output.jfif (life alert bracelet image)
Used steg program to on new.jpg "python3 Steg_01.py -r -B -2048 -i8 -w output.jfif > new.jpg giving us cyber image


Gabe Contribution: Once Rupp gave us the password to the zip file I decoded the files using base64 for the IP address. Once we used program 5 to get the IP password I logged into the ftp server, found the files we needed, and used the get command on them to download them to my virtual machine. I also helped a little bit in writing the steg program that we used to find the final hidden message.
