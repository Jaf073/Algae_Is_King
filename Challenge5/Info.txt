Epoch time = 2019 05 08 10 00 00
IP = 138.47.99.228
output of edited Program 5 = gives us password


Downloaded provided zip file
Cracked zip file password by passing it through a website (password = passw0rd)
Decoded the two gibberish file names using base 64 -> gave us Epoch time and IP
Used modified program 5 with epoc time and local machine time to get IP password
Logged into ftp server and grabbed the two files we needed
Used XOR program to decode the cipher file giving us output.jfif (life alert bracelet image)
Used steg program to on new.jpg "python3 Steg_01.py -r -B -2048 -i8 -w output.jfif > new.jpg giving us cyber image
Steg: python3 Steg_01.py -r -b -o513 -i2 -w output.jfif > constitution.txt to give us the constitution
Incomplete secret passphrase with: python3 Steg_01.py -r -B -o32 -i64 -w constitution.txt > secretmessage.txt


Gabe Contribution: Once Rupp gave us the password to the zip file I decoded the files using base64 for the IP address. Once we used program 5 to get the IP password I logged into the ftp server, found the files we needed, and used the get command on them to download them to my virtual machine. I also helped a little bit in writing the steg program that we used to find the final hidden message.

Tommy Contribution: Decoded the the file names to get the IP address and Epoch time, but I know I was not the only one who did this step. After that I logged into the ftp server the grabbed the key and cipher files.

Andrew Contribution: Ran the XOR and Steg programs

Hayden Contribution:
	I found the password for the zip file by running it through a site on the internet. I modified program 5 in order to get the ftp password

Kaylee Contribution:
	I wrote the program 5 python file. Also helped with brainstorming to get the final message. 

John Contribution: I helped making and troubleshooting the Steg file
